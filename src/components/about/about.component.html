          Imagine a dreamer who turned her wanderlust into a journey of laughter
          and adventure. That’s me, <b>Bhumi</b>, the mind and soul behind
          Barefoot Nomads. For years, I’ve dreamt of crafting a travel
          experience that goes beyond the ordinary—a journey where each step is
          as enriching as the destination itself.
        </p>
        <p class="para-font-style">
          With over 100 trips under my belt, I’ve seen laughter become the
          universal language of every adventure. I’ve spent 6+ years exploring
          this world I adore, soaking in every culture and landscape. For me,
          it’s not just about the places; it’s the people who make each journey
          unforgettable.

          They say it’s not the destination but the company that makes the
          travel special. And at Barefoot Nomads, we embody that spirit. We’ve
          trekked through 10+ destinations, weaving together both rugged trails
          and leisurely escapes. I’m not just a guide; I’m the heart of a team
          that handles everything—from leadership and sales to execution and
          social media—with an unquenchable thirst for learning.

    <p class="para-font-style">
      My journey into the world of adventure began during my undergraduate years
      studying mass communication. Early on, I discovered a deep-seated passion
      for exploration and traveling. This realization led me to work with
      several travel agencies, where I honed my skills and learned the
      intricacies of crafting memorable travel experiences. As time went on, I
      felt a growing desire to carve my own path in the industry. With a heart
      full of wanderlust and a mind brimming with ideas, I decided to start my
      own thing: <b>Barefoot Nomads</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 para-font-style">
      At Barefoot Nomads, my goal was clear—to offer both ready-made and customized adventure packages that would cater to the unique desires and dreams of each adventurer. From bustling cities to remote paradises, I aimed to create journeys that left a lasting impact. Soon, adventurers began to trust us to deliver unforgettable experiences since then It's been a journey of passion, learning, and fulfillment, proving that when you follow your dreams, incredible things can happen.
